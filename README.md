### Guest Segmentation: 
We used the Tree Map chart to categorize each customer into four types of segments
   - We found out each Group's total revenue generated
   - Average spending of each group
   - Number of Guests under that Category

### 🧠Insights

1. Maximum amount of revenue was generated by Occasional Stayers but the average money spent by the VIP Guest was maximum as compared to other Groups.
2. Loyal Guest had the least number of Customers but the average spending was more than Occasional stayers and first time visitors

### Guest Booking trends: 
Used scatter plot to find out frequency of bookings done by each segment
- Booking frequency and amount paid was more by occasional and VIP Guests. Loyal Guests remained at middle level whereas first time spent minimum amount with less booking frequency
- can introduce offers for first time customers to increase their interest and retention into the resort.

### Guest Booking Summary shows an overall summary of amount paid and booking frequency by each customer

### Age group distribution shows that percentage of Middle Age customers is more as compared to young adults - social media marketing can be used to target young customers.

## Recommendations

1. Offer Exclusive Packages to Young Customers like Valentine or Birthday Special Programs 
2. Launch milestone-based incentives to attract and convert occasional customers into more regular customers to boost revenue
3. VIP Guests tend to increase more so introduce some new VIP services to attract more VIP customers
4. Build targeted promotions and incentives for first time customers to increase their engagement. offer discount on services for first time users to give them exposure to the resort services    and giving them a good experience on their first visits to gain trust and loyalty.
